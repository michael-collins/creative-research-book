# Write a story: draft 2

For this activity, you will write a second draft of your first story (500 words minimum) interpreting feedback and making adjustments where necessary.

##Steps to completion:

1. Read the feedback students wrote about your story
2. Use these structural components as a guide to tune-up your story:
  - The world as it was
  - And then one day...
  - Raising the stakes
  - Moment of change
  - World as it is now
3. Read the story aloud to yourself
  - This helps you see if it has good energy 
4. Submit story to the Studio

**Note:** These components are a checklist and are not meant to always be used in the order they are listed, though they often are. 

## Feedback Instructions

1. Props 
  - Start out feedback by giving props to the writer for something that was well done, positive, interesting, or insightful.
2. Leave comments, questions, and suggestions:
  - Could you easily identify the structural elements?
  - Could something be added or changed to increase dramatic contrast?
  - Was there a moment in the story that was satisfying or exciting?

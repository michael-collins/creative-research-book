# Future living

## Background
In their speculative design project, [United Micro Kingdoms (UmK): A Design Fiction](http://www.unitedmicrokingdoms.org/), Dunne and Raby explore the value systems of fictional cultures and their built environments. These societies, while invented, are framed in such a way that has the viewer trying to self categorize and better understand their own value systems. See [discursive design](../topics/discursive_design.md).

Just as Dunne and Raby's UmK project proposed possible new ways of living based on value systems, you will generate and visualize possible ways of living. You will do this by creating How Might We (HMW) questions to better understand themes, challenges, and opportunities for living in the future.

### Deliverable 1: Generate HMW Question
[Complete Futurecasting worksheet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eYc1Jnw937SZmfk0vvyZl-N265pWCgvpkAypJXCOX50/edit?usp=sharing) with your assigned partner. You will each complete this on your own, but can ask your partner for help if you get stuck. Your pair word for the worksheet is "LIVING"

(This should take no more than 45 minutes to complete)


Example completed worksheet: **[TODO - create example completed worksheet]**

Upload your completed worksheet to the assignment dropbox.

### Deliverable 2: HMW Visualization
Create a digital or physical collage based on your sketch from the futurecasting worksheet that communicates your HMW question. You may combine appropriated images, sketches, typography, and photographs.

Example collage: **[TODO - create example collage]**

(This should take approximately 1 hour)

Upload your completed visual to the assignment dropbox. Please follow [documentation guidelines](../toolkit/documentation_guidelines.md).

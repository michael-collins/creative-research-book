For this activity, you will create a visual "How To" guide that explains how to operate, perform, or otherwise understand some aspect of daily life that you once struggled to understand. It can be anything from visually explaining how to tie a knot to instructions for proper posture while sitting. The more personal to your own experiences, the better.

## Process
1. Select something you've struggled to understand for which you would like to create a visual how-to guide
  - Practice KISS.
2. Choose the **graphic structure** that best suits the kind of how-to guide you are making. This could be any of the following:
  - storyboard  
  - flow-chart

  - doodle
3. Use a pencil, pen, or marker to draw your how-to guide on paper. 
  - Use a scanner for best results.

# Daily Design Journal

In this activity, you will document at least one object each day for two weeks \(14 object sketches total\) using your journal. Keeping a sketchbook or journal with you is a useful habit for tracking observations and ideas. In this activity, we will use this practice to make observations about objects that are close to us every day.

## Journal sketching requirements

1. Please number the object sketch at the top of the page 
2. Draw your object in the upper 2/3 of the journal page
3. Write details and observations in the lower 1/3 of the journal page and include the name of the object.

**Note:** Because this course is not a life drawing course or industrial design course, the quality of your drawings are irrelevant to your grade. If you are interested in seeing how a product is typically sketched, you can take a look at [this video of Reid Schlegel of Frog Design demonstrating his technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqqGox6Jwvk). Sketching and rendering by hand is something that anyone can learn, but it takes quite a number of years of practice. If you are interested in learning, I recommend spending some time on [Core77.com's sketching page](http://www.core77.com/Sketching).

## Materials

* Pencil, pen, marker
* Sketching Journal (Recommend Moleskine Cahiers Squared Journals)

## Instructions

1. Visually document an object each day for two weeks \(14 object sketches total\) that is typical for you to interact with in your daily life. You can use pen, pencil, markers, or any combination you'd like. 
2. Write contextual notes about the objects' materials, dimensions, and functionality. Focus on the design (shape, form, etc.) of the object and how that relates to the way you interact with it. You may also include information about what the purpose is or where you acquired it. Be thorough and specific, as if you're an archaeologist examining an artifact. 
3. Please follow the journal sketching requirements.

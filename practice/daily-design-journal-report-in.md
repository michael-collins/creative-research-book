# Daily Design Journal

Now that you have documented at least one object each day for two weeks, it's time to talk about it, shown-and-tell style.

## Prompt

1. From the 14 objects that you sketched, which are your favorite objects? Why?
2. Select one object from your list. What role does this object play in your life? What would be the result if you did not have it anymore?
3. Do you generally take these objects for granted or are they special?

## Instructions

1. Respond to the prompt questions in Studio.
2. Upload all 14 of your sketches in JPG format.
    - **Please either use a scanner or take clear and well lit photographs.**
2. Write your responses to the prompt questions at the end of the two weeks.

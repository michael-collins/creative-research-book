# Pathway design activity

A _**pathway**_ describes a literal or metaphorical route or series of events connecting a current condition to a future condition. In biochemistry, metabolic pathways describe sequences of chemical reactions that occur in living organisms. In physiology, neural pathways describe chains of cells that carry signals connecting one part of the nervous system to another. And in the context of education, a _learning pathway_ describes the sequence and range of knowledge a learner acquires over a duration of time. Your learning pathway, often referred to as a "trajectory," is not always controllable, and can branch drastically in different directions as your values shift or constraints and opportunities emerge. With that said, to start down a pathway, it can be helpful to imagine the end-point of a learning pathway and work backwards to generate a strategy.

In this activity, you will respond to a series of questions aimed at helping you identify what you want to learn, and what you want to be really good at doing. This can breaking into a new career, mastery of a skill or field of inquiry, production of a body of work, or the pursuit of a cause, and more. You will then use your answers to write a document detailing your intent and a timeline of important events.

## Part 1: Pathway Questionnaire

[MS Word Document File Download](https://github.com/dmd-program/dmd-100-sp17/raw/aa1852a1f5fa257c4c6c794d3071bc5f4dca586d/assets/pathway-questionnaire.docx)

The following questions are designed to help you think about what you may want or need related to your learning goals. For example, if you know that you would need to have an internship to achieve your goal, you would mention a type of internship and some possible companies: "I will need experience from a 3D animation internship at a large studio similar to Pixar or BlueSky." Ensure that your answers are very specific.

1. **Subject area**
   * What skills do you want to master?; OR what do you want to learn how to do?; OR What is your dream job?
2. **Related knowledge**
   * What related or foundational knowledge do you already have?
   * What knowledge will you need to acquire?
   * How will you gain this knowledge? \(Specific courses, supplemental learning, specific books, etc.\)
3. **Behavioral patterns**
   * Can you identify behaviors that propel you along your trajectory?
   * Can you identify behaviors that hold you back. \(mental attitudes, beliefs, actions, and activities\)
   * How might you eliminate or alter behaviors that work against your goals?
   * What new behaviors might you employ?
4. **Resources**
   * What tools will you need to further your creative practice?
   * What steps are you taking to procure these tools?
5. **People**
   * Who encourages and supports your trajectory?
   * Is there anyone who holds you back or is negative about your aspirations?
   * Can you identify communities of practice locally or virtually?
   * In an ideal world, who could you ask for help, motivation, or advice?
6. **Events**
   * What events, conversations, internships,  or interactions need to take place? When?
   * What physical experiences will help you? \(internships, research trips, etc.\)
7. **Accountability**
   * What or who will hold you accountable? Will you include a reward or disciplinary system?

## Part 2 - Write a Learning Strategy Document

Now that you have completed the questionnaire, use your answers to write a learning strategy document.

1. Write your name and date at the top of the document
2. **Statement of Intent**
   * Rephrase your answer to **Subject Area** as a statement of intent. Example: "I intend to become... I will do this by..."
   * Rewrite your other questionnaire responses as a few concise paragraphs to communicate how you will achieve your learning goals.
   * The _**Statement of Intent**_ must be a minimum of 300 words and no more than 500 words.
3. **Pathway Schedule:**
   * Include a dated list of the things you will need to acquire or accomplish. Example: _"December 2018: find a list of animation studios to apply to, February 2019: Apply for 3D animation internships"_

# Concept development
## Choose
The issue, otherwise known as the theme, is the impetus for writing a story in the first place. This should be based on a topic that you are passionate about and interested in exploring.

## Contextualize
Now that you have deconstructed the issue at hand, it is time to apply the insights to plausible scenarios and expressions of possible solutions.

## Present
Form refers to shape of the idea's expression. Whether written, visual, or physically constructed, you give your audience a method for engaging with your ideas. Refer to the formal constraints of the project for details.

## Deconstruct
To deconstruct a creative work, you must first understand what other ideas the work is made of. Figuring out what those parts are, and how they are combined, can lead to moments of insight for both the creator and viewer.

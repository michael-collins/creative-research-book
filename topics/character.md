# Character

In fictional film or literature, character types are used to help viewers to empathize with the story. A person's character typically refers to the qualities they possess. However, a character can also be an animal, object, or abstraction in a story. Objects are often represented through anthropomorphism, where human attributes are applied to a non-human. According to an [explainer video about animated light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf0WjeE6eyM) for the movie, Akira, the city itself was considered to be a character. Other examples of non-human characters include Lightning McQueen from [Cars \(2006\)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/) and a homicidal car tire named Robert in the movie [Rubber \(2010\)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612774/).

## Characterization

In the process of characterization, a writer will construct traits of a character according to how they will serve the story's plot requirements. Characters are often inspired by people from real life, but often become simplified, combined, and adapted as needed.

See [tvtropes.org wiki](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationTropes) for an expansive collection of characterization tropes.

## Types \(tropes\) in fictional stories

Character types are often one or a combination of the following:

1. **Main character:** We experience the story through this character's eyes.
2. **Supporting character:** These characters help us understand the main character, advance the story.
3. **Protagonist character:** The story typically follows this character most closely. They are needed to resolve the conflict and typically have heroic qualities.
4. **Antagonist character:** Tries to prevent the story goal. Opposes the protagonist.
5. **Dynamic character:** Shows development and change over time.
6. **Static character:** Does not develop or change over time.
7. **Anti-hero character:** Protagonist who lacks heroic qualities.
8. **Round character:** Well developed, complex, sometimes contradictory traits.
9. **Flat character:** Not well developed, static.
10. **Stock character:** Archetypal, stereotypical, and flat.
11. **Foil character:** Typically contrasts the main character in qualities and values so that we may learn more about the main character.
12. **Symbolic character:** This character represents an abstract concept like "hope" or "justice."

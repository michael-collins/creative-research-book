# Language

A human's development and use of language is 

Language is a technology that allows people and things to communicate in a reliable and repeatable fashion. All of modern society, for better or worse, is made possible in part by language's continued development and application. The fields of science, applied sciences, art, and liberal arts have different ways of describing the use of language, its application, and it's components.

## Metalanguage
Language is powerful because it allows humans and non-humans alike to liberate or oppress, create or destroy, incite or quell, enlighten or obscure. The fundamental building blocks of a language can be considered to be a metalanguage; abstract concepts that construct the language in question. Many different languages can be created from a metalanguage.

Metalanguage applies to every kind of communication, including visual, auditory, digital, etc. Being able to understand the abstract ways in which something is being communicated plays an important role in the mastery of that communication. When communicating a new idea, in particular with a visual language, explanation of the structure and parts of the metalanguage are often a major point of discussion. Understanding metalanguage often enables one to more easily obtain mastery. It provide insight as to the "why" that many seek during the learning process.

### Examples:
**To describe speech within the English language, you need to understand the following metalanguage parts:**

* Noun
* Pronoun
* Verb
* Adjective
* Adverb
* Preposition
* Conjunction
* Interjection

* Elementary statements
  * Metalanguage: string, function, loop, 
* Statement linking mechanisms
* Can receive data input

## Sub-language
In addition to metalanguage, you can also have sublanguage, or a nuanced use of existing language that allows for more diverse or clear meaning to be created. When different sublanguages have shared expressions, the meaning being communicated can become confused. This is why when two people who study in two different fields use the same word to describe something, there is an increased chance for miscommunication. Those two people must work to understand each other's uncommon use of the language and may require an interpreter who is versed in both sublanguages to faciliate communication.

## Design and language
Designers take on many roles where language plays an important role, including that of facilitator and educator. As people develop a better understanding of how good design happens, the field expands to incorporate aspects of previously unrelated subjects. Design leaders are expected to be well versed in many languages, sub languages, and metalanguages. This knowledge is essential because designers spend a considerable amount of time translating one language to another, be it written to visual, spoken to programmed, and so on.

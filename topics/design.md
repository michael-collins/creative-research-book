# Design

There is one central idea that is reiterated in countless books and lectures about design. The notion is this; everything a person experiences, from the time they wake up to the time they go to bed, has been designed by someone. Steve Jobs famously recounts this idea in the following passage,

> When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. 
> 
> Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. 
> 
> That's a very limited life. 
>
> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. 
> 
> Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

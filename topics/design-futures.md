# Design futures

What does design look like in the future? Will designers exist in the future, or will they [go the way of the horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU), a once needed laborer put out of work by technological advancement and social change.

## Autonomy

### Digital machines

There are many companies that have now come to exemplify the value of automation. Amazon has it's cloud platform that many of the larger social platforms rely on for service. Their infrastructure is built on the idea that servers can automatically be produced, scale to demand, replicate, and then shut down again when they aren't needed. You could not possibly hire enough people to perform these tasks manually for reasonable cost. Another company, DigitalOcean.com, allows you to create a web server in seconds according to your preferences for fractions of a dollar. An IT department at a University would require $40,000 to purchase the hardware and manually configure the machine. You may be reading this text while enrolled in a course at Penn State University. If so, the system that is serving it to the Internet relies heavily on automation, allowing one developer to manage hundreds, and possibly thousands of online courses. You can now fairly cheaply launch your own competing Facebook or Twitter.

To some extent, the computer and the Internet has led to automated design. You don't need to worry about font, alignment, and the myriad of other aspects of typographic design in order to produce a MS Word document. Likewise, you can have charts and graphs, logos, and other aspects of graphic design automated (as long as you don't value uniqueness).

Where could it be going? Tesla is producing the [Gigafactory](https://www.tesla.com/gigafactory), a self-contained production facility. Perhaps in 15 or 20 years, you will easily be able to launch your own car production company using the services of automated factories much in the same way you can rent servers from Amazon.

## Artificial intelligence

Like many of the topics introduced in this course, artificial intelligence (AI) is a big subject. Tim Urban from Waitbutwhy.com did a particularly lengthy (and highly unsettling) investigation of the scope of AI's impact in a post called, _[The AI Revolution: The Road to Superintelligence](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html)_.

The gist of it is this: technology is improving and the rate at which it improves may begin to happen at an exponential rate. AI will operate in the same way, where it will teach itself so fast that there will be mere moments between a machine knowing as much as a child and knowing as much as the collective global human intelligence. This isn't a given, but it is a possible future reality. If this happens, we'll have more to worry about than scarcity of design jobs, so let us pull back our focus to what's happening now.

### AI designers

A company called The Grid [ claims that an AI](https://blog.thegrid.io/the-wizard-of-gridsites-molly-your-new-ai-bff/), introduced on their blog as Molly, is learning how to build websites. For a fee, you can sign up and she'll build one for you as well. The experience of using The Grid and employing Molly as your designer, while a considerable feat of engineering, is unfortunately incredibly unsatisfying. Firstly, you really can't understand why Molly is making the decisions that it is. If you don't like the decisions, then you can fill out a rating form, and press the generate button. After about a half hour, you begin to realize the futility of the process, and it would be better to just make it the way you want by getting your hands dirty. Second, this is the antithesis of Open Design â€” not only is the design process hidden, but you can't ask the designer about the decisions that were made and you certainly can't make meaningful design changes.

AI design will fail in the near future until it learns to take the IKEA effect seriously, and incorporate the user into the process in a more meaningful way.

### Self-assembly

> Self-Assembly is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure through local interaction.

At the MIT [Self-Assembly Lab](http://www.selfassemblylab.net/), [researchers](http://www.selfassemblylab.net/laboratory_team.php) are looking to infuse materials with the ability to self-configure, respond, and change states. One of the core ideas motivating this research is that in nature, things self-arrange at the micro-scale seen in biology; and at the macro-scale as seen in visible in phenomenon throughout the Universe. People have already had some success creating self-assembling systems at a human scale, but not on other scales as seen in nature. What if a building could make or alter itself based on a a pre-programmed set of stimuli? What role does a designer play in this process?

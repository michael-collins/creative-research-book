# Lifelong learning

Right now, there exists a series of actions, that if you followed perfectly, could land you your dream job, make you wealthy, save someone's life, solve the affordable housing crisis, slow climate change, eliminate poverty, and end all war. Frustratingly, you don't know what these actions are until after someone else has successfully completed them. Certainly we can't know for sure what effect our actions will have until after we perform them, but we can make educated guesses, particularly in a stable society. For instance, retirement planning for U.S. citizens involves investing consistently in a 401K retirement plan, a system where everyone hopes that the financial market will continue growing. If the market was in a constant state of volatility, it would not be a viable option for retirement planning.

## Career trajectory

Much in the same way you make investments in the market, you make investments in yourself. You do this by routinely equipping yourself with the knowledge and experience needed to propel you along a particular trajectory. Establishing goals along the trajectory is helpful, not only to provide moments of celebration and reflection, but as a way to make decisions less scary and more manageable.

Let's break this process down. Let's say you have just graduated from high school and are lucky enough to know exactly what you want to do with your life. Developing a career trajectory and goals would be easy. The trajectory is "work as a UX designer" and the series of goals include: find out what a UX designer does, find out what qualities and qualifications employers look for in a UX designer, take steps to attain those qualities and qualifications, produce enough work to become good at UX design, and interview for jobs at companies that perform UX design services. This process might take four to six years, but it is very attainable. Unfortunately, you aren't done. Technology  and methods within the field continually change, which means if you do not keep learning, your skillset will become obsolete.

That is all well and good if you know what you want, but what if you don't know what you want to do? How do you find a trajectory then? The majority of people don't know what they want to do, so this is not worth stressing over. Start with something more general, such as "creative production." As long as you are doing something creative, you are on the right path. Explore as many fields, technology, and processes as you can as quickly as you can to see if something strikes a chord. Sometimes, the path of least resistance is the best option. However, if the path of least resistance pulls you away from creative practice or minimizes your access to resources, then this is not a good option. Start saying yes to things that keep you producing, learning, and creates opportunities for growth. Creative design projects that I started out designing include logos and websites for family and friends, diagrams for reports, part-time teaching, freelance illustration and graphic design, small animation projects, photography and video, product concept drawings, furniture design, and more. While none of these projects won any design awards or paid very well, they all led to more work and allowed me to build knowledge and experience.

## Networks

Most people did not get to where they are without the help, guidance, support, and risk of someone else. These people form your network, and the larger and more tightly-knit your network is, the more likely you are to succeed. How does one grow a network of people? For one, you have to not be a jerk. No one likes spending time with jerks, and niche creative industries can be quite small. You never know who knows who, so it is best to always be kind to others. Second, you have to go find people. Volunteerism is a great way to meet people, particularly if it is for an event related to your career trajectory. While linkedin.com makes it easy to keep track of professional connections, those connections are fairly superficial without an in-person relationship to back it up. Don't just meet people in the industry, become close friends with people in the industry. Take advantage of portfolio review days, conferences, and other networking events. Join student groups at your college or University â€” they often have funding opportunities. Find some mentors who will give you a straight answer. Have social media accounts and contacts specifically for generating a professional web presence.

# Critical Making

\[1\]

> Open design heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars, and interested citizens to engage in a simultaneously conceptual and material critique of technologies and information systems in society

The term 'critical making' is intended to highlight the interwoven material and conceptual work that making involves. As a teaching and research strategy, critical making shares an emphasis on values with both critical design and critical practices — such as the critical technical practice\[2\] from which is derives, as well as value-sensitive-design\[3\] and values-in-design\[4\].

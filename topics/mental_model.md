# Mental model

A mental model is the brains constructed understanding of how cause and effect works in reality. Essentially, this is your understanding of how the world works so you can anticipate what will happen next. Mental models can be both useful and obstructionist. Knowing how to understand and articulate a person's mental model will aid the design process. Identifying the circumstances in which a mental model is failing to account for given outcomes can be helpful for designers when determining which assumptions to question.

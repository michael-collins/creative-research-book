# Programming
Programming essentially means an entity (the programmer) ascribes functionality and instructions (the program) to an active agent (something that can run a program). One of the most complex examples of one such system is the human brain. Though the human brain transports information more slowly than a modern computer, it can perform calculations in parallel at a scale many orders of magnitude greater than what computers can currently achieve [1]. Who or what programs the brain? DNA? Your parents? The weather outside? Scientists will be no doubt be very busy trying to understand these questions better over the coming century.



## Computer science
### Open Textbooks
[Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/SearchResults.aspx?subjectAreaId=3) 
### Paradigms [2]
A programming language can mix paradigms despite being described as a particular type.

1. Imperative
2. Procedural
3. Declarative
4. Functional
5. Object-oriented
6. Event-driven
7. Automata-based

### Parts of a program [3]

1. Variable
  * Stores data.
  * Different programming languages store different types of data.
  * Common types of data: Character, Integer, Boolean, Array (list of other variables, String (array of characters), Floating-point number
2. Control Structures
  * Applies logical decision making to existing conditions for desired outcomes.
  * Common examples include *if statements* and *loops*
  * [AI control structures](http://www.pling.org.uk/cs/lpa.html) are very complex
3. Data Structures
  * Describes how data is stored and accessed
  * Common types
    * Linear
    * Tree
    * Hash
    * Graph
4. Syntax
  * Symbol combinations that describe the program within a particular language

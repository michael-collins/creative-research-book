# Audience

## Market-based

When a car manufacturer designs a car, the first consideration is who will be buying the car. There is no benefit in making a car that no one will buy. This is the same with any product or service. It's easy to recognize the audience when you are making a product because the product is designed around the customer's wants and needs. If you are unsure what kind of person a car manufacturer is targeting, look to their marketing for answers.

But what about when giving a presentation at work where you want to prove the viability of your team's ideas, or going an interview where you have to demonstrate competence to an employer, or organizing a mural project where you want to inspire the community to dream bigger? Each of those instances is a kind of strategic conversation that includes an act of making – be they slides, a painting, or a conversation – and if the audience isn't considered in the decision making process, a bad outcome is likely to occur.

## Fan service

Story genre fan bases are essentially markets. When a storyteller is complicit with fan service \(fulfills the expectations of fans\), it means they are catering to a market that buys a particular kind of story, valued more by publishers as products rather than creative and expressive works. This exists heavily in literature, film, cartoons, video games, and other forms of media.

## Data-driven

Media companies have spent a long time learning how to deliver stories to more people than ever before in human history, and with the emergence of the Big Data industry, they now have the information needed to precisely target customers. When television, radio, and newspapers were the three central media outlets for telling stories about current events, there was no accurate way to target an individual member of the vast, but invisible audience. However, advances in social media platforms now make this a standard occurrence. Advertisers use metadata gathered from the ubiquitous tracking of all acts a person expresses through digital devices, creating a market for consumer data and the resulting Big Data industry.

There are many issues surrounding Big Data, the biggest of which tends to include privacy and security. Big Data also has other far-reaching social implications. By catering to an individual's existing perceptions and knowledge, confirmation bias, which contributes to the divergence of the understanding of reality amongst society, is now an attribute of a customer's marketing persona. Only when there is a market imperative for confronting social media users with countering stories can people gain exposure to a larger base of perspectives.

## Strategic stories

**Here are some examples of audience:**

* **Architect:** building inhabitants, engineers, code inspectors, construction workers
* **A supermarket owner:** shoppers, food suppliers, workers
* **Hollywood film producer:** causal movie-goers, hardcore fans

Each of these situations involves strategy, which is developed to guide the design process. It is helpful to model the

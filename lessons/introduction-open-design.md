# Introduction

In this lesson, you will be learning about **open design**, a paradigm where design operates in a transparent, self-initiated, and collaborative environment.

You will continue to practice the Double Diamond design process by creating your third course project, where you will generate a physical prototype based on some common open design principles. You will also continue reading and responding to the writing prompts for _Design and Truth_ book chapters, and will have the opportunity to watch a lecture by Thomas Lommee.

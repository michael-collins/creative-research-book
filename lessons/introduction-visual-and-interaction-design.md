# Introduction

In this lesson you will learn about design topics that expand your understanding of the visual and conceptual nature of design.

You will put the Double Diamond design process into practice to produce the first course project, where you will conduct design thinking exercises and build an interactive mobile application prototype. You will also finish the journal activity, continue _Design and Truth_ book chapter reading assignments, and have a chance to listen to some more design podcasts.

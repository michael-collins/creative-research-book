# Corporate Redesign and the Business of Knowledge

Corporate Redesign and the Business of Knowledge \(p. 150-165\) in Design and Truth by Robert Grudin.

## Writing prompt

In this chapter, Grudin describes arguments over imbuing corporate free market endeavors with moral imperatives, one of which is truthfulness. He also draws correlations between communication of knowledge within a company and its health. He examines Google as a case study in corporate knowledge investment and makes the case for the Chief Knowledge Officer.

Let's say you were hired, just as Grudin was, to be a consultant for a large company. How might you redesign the knowledge embedded within that company or its products? What challenges would you face as a Chief Knowledge Officer or implementing design ideas in corporate settings in general?

The Lady in the Picture: Design and Revelation in Renaissance Art \(p. 88-104\) in Design and Truth by Robert Grudin

## Writing prompt

In this chapter, Grudin gives us a glimpse into specific moments of knowledge design during the Renaissance through examining  paintings, architecture, writing, and opera. I encourage you to look up the works referenced in the passages as you read to visualize them. 

What distinctive characteristics does Grudin highlight to support his argument that these works are examples of **knowledge design**? With those examples in mind, can you relate them to specific pieces of contemporary creative work that succeed or fail to embed knowledge? Describe specific visual details and how they relate to the work's function in society or the creator's perspective.

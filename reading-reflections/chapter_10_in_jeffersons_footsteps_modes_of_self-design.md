# In Jefferson's Footsteps: Modes of Self-Design

In Jefferson's Footsteps: Modes of Self-Design \(p. 105-116\) in Design and Truth by Robert Grudin.

## Writing prompt

In this chapter, Grudin talks briefly about humanity's departure from synergy with the natural world through the rise in urbanism and the relationship of normative social structure on free expression, free inquiry, and free enterprise. He also highlights the underlying humanist attitudes that propelled Thomas Jefferson and Niccol√≤ Machiavelli to great accomplishment and segues into lessons on self-design. 

Grudin suggests that a 40 hour work week is not a universally applicable working paradigm, and that designing an intentional day to include mechanisms of growth can teach us each to expand our own nature. For this writing prompt, I would like you to examine what Grudin means by self-design and to design your own **Intentional Day Schedule**. What would be in your day? What mechanisms of growth would you include?  How would you balance social and work interactions? Be specific!

## Prepare images for upload

If you are working from photos that are not the correct size and aspect ratio, you will need to crop them to prepare them for upload.

There are free image cropping tools included with Mac and Windows operating systems: 

* [Windows](http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/56624/how-to-rotate-crop-photos-in-windows-10/)
* [Mac OS](http://osxdaily.com/2014/06/16/crop-image-mac-preview/)

To keep organized, it helps to number your files. If you forgot an image and include it after the fact, you can use a decimal instead of renaming all of the files.

## Share prototype link

1. On the project view, click on the big green share link on the top left.
2. Click on the public share link to copy it to your clipboard. \(This sets your computer so the next time you perform a paste command, it will paste the link\)

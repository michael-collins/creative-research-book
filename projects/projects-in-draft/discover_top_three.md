Local knowledge describes a kind of knowledge that is specific to your own experiences. Is this step, you will create a mind map to try to better understand your local knowledge.



## Instructions

1. Write your name in the middle of an 8.5"x11" sheet of paper placed horizontally.
2. In the space around your name, write _**skills**_, _**weaknesses**_, _**familiar**_, and _**unfamiliar**_. Draw lines from the center circle to each category.
3. From each category, try to write no less than **five** specific ideas:
   * **Skills:** These are things you are good at. They include hard and soft skills like cooking or conversation.
   * **Weaknesses:** Things you have done or currently do, but perhaps not so well.
   * **Familiar:** These are places, topics, scenarios, and issues, that you are somewhat or very knowledgeable about.
   * **Unfamiliar:** These are places, topics, scenarios, and issues, that you are note knowledgeable about, but have some interest in knowing.
4. Tips:
   1. The more specific you can be, the better. Your answers can be funny or serious, but consider your audience and try not to over-share.
   2. Go for breadth instead of depth. For instance, you could name all of the dishes that you are skilled at cooking, but this limits the topic possibilities to one category of skill. Instead list one or two of your best options, and write skills from other categories.
5. Spend 30 minutes to an hour writing as many specific ideas as you can. This process will give you good overview of your "local" knowledge and interests.

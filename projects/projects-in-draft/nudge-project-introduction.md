# Nudge Project
For this project, you will design a nudge, and document its results. It could be entirely image-based, video-based, or text-based, or a combination of media. There is a huge range of subjects, be they technical, instructional, personal, satirical, comedic, from popular culture, etc. You will narrow and identify the focus over the course of completing project deliverables.


Choose an idea that is not too broad in scope so that you can complete the guide within the given time.

After you complete the project, you will have the option to have your project digitally indexed for public consumption.

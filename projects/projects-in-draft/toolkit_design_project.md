## Project brief

In this project, you will be designing a toolkit. Toolkits are developed as a means to help people put learned concepts into practice. This project will result in the development of a toolkit that includes two steps; a concept teaching step and an implementation step. You will help users of your toolkit generate ideas and then put those ideas into action.

Project must contain a set of step-by-step, visual instructions specifying an approximate time it should take a person to complete each step.

### Scope and constraints

You will be creating a web-based toolkit that uses hyperlinks and principles of narrative to guide a person through the use of the toolkit. The toolkit must follow accessibility guidelines. The toolkit must be feasible for a person to complete in an hour.

### Example project

### Case studies

## Learning resources

### Readings and screenings
[Open Design](../topics/open_design.md)

[What Difference Does a Form Make: Redesign and Evaluation of a Form for Documenting In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/22800/Au_washington_0250E_11500.pdf)

### Tools and techniques

- Tutorial: Creating a toolkit tutorial from start to finish
  - [Project management toolkit](../toolkit/project_management.md) **[include same delvierables as this assignment]**
    - This will also double as an included tool for helping students manage their creative projects! *Sneaky!*
- Illustrator tutorial **[Locate on Lynda.com and youtube]**
- PDF creation tutorial **[Locate on Lynda.com and youtube]**

## Steps to completion

1. Go through the Double Diamond process
2. Test and obtain feedback **[link to testing methodology from stanford d.school's toolkit]**
3. Produce documentation
3. Iterate design
4. Test and obtain feedback
5. Produce documentation
6. Iterate design
7. Publish
8. Reflect

## Deliverables

Based on [Double Diamond](../topics/double_diamond.md) method.

1. Research investigation
  - Images and tags (some kind of studio interface?)
2. Re-briefing presentation, How might we questions
  - Blog post with write-up
3. Ideation process documentation
  - Blog post with images (on personal portfolio site) 
4. Development log/journal
  - Blog post: Discuss design iterations based on feedback 
5. Proposed solution
  - PDF Document
  - Blog post reflection on project

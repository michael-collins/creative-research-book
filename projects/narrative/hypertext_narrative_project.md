## Project brief
 In this project, you will be creating a hypertext narrative. You will use software called Twine to construct a non-linear story that describes an event in the near future. The goal of this project is to present an issue and allow your audience to explore it in an engaging way.
 
 Framing a contemporary issue within the context of a fictional technological and social reality can help a designer to discover new and surprising insights. The science fiction genre does this extensively, often by showing events that result in undesired consequences, inspiring the audience into self-reflection.
 
 This short story called [story], by [author] is a good example of a 
 
### process
- discover
  - locate 5 news articles to be the seed for story ideas
  - Free associate as many words related to the articles as possible.
- define
  - Write short sentences based on those words
  - Define the main themes of the story
- develop
  - characters, plot
- deliver
  - Twine
### Technical format

- **Video:** Video of a sample project being created
- Must create a twine, and upload to a specified location on github.com.

### Formal constraints
* Non-linear narrative structure (hyperlinks allow you to experience the story in a way not tied to chronological events). Viewers are allowed and encouraged to jump to different points along the plot diagram.
* Text must be written primarily in English language, but can make use of other languages.
* Pages must contain at least one hyperlink
* Must contain the following types of hyperlinks:
  - Link for performing an action. **(Example image)**
  - Link to a page that describes a physical space (real or imagined). **(Example image)**
  - Link that describes a character. **(Example image)**
  - Link that progresses you through the plot (can be any of the other types of links). **(Example image)**
* Assessment emphasis is not placed on styling, layout, and color. You are free to style as desired through CSS and related methods compatible with Twine. However, please ensure there is enough contrast between text, background, and links to maintain readability. All default style options are acceptable for submission.

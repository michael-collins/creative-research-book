# Develop: Story and plot elements

You will now write a fictional, yet _**plausible**_ story that describes how this imagined future 30 years from now came to be. For example, Unicorns are not plausible to exist in 30 years \(unless you make a compelling CRISPR argument\), but autonomous flying cars are plausible.

The story should describe the evolution of the world as it is now to the world 30 years in the future**,** using characters and dramatic story structure. 

## Requirements

* **Positive content:** The result of the plot must be of a positive future.
* **Plausible:** The story must be in the realm of technological and scientific plausibility.
* **Conduct research:** Find articles or books that help support the plausible nature of story. For instance, if some new technology is being used, find credible sources that help support it's use in your story.

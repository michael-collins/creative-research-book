# Discover: Word-pairs

## Materials

1. Pen or pencil
2. Journal

## Instructions

Please allow at least 60-75 minutes to complete this activity.

1. In your journal, write three objects from your home. If you cannot think of any, choose three objects from a random object generator. Here is [one](http://roger.redevised.com/).
2. Free association writing. \(10 mins\)
   * On a journal page, write as many words about each object as you can.
   * When you are done, circle any **three** words.
3. Choose **one** focus word from the list below. Write the adjectives circled from the previous step in front of your chosen focus word, creating three word-pairs \(I.E. - if you choose education, you would combine your adjectives with only education\):
   * education
   * economy
   * health
   * wellness
   * transportation
   * technology
   * government
   * freedom
   * justice
   * democracy
   * business
   * trade
   * environment
   * food
   * agriculture
   * ecosystem
   * energy
   * labor
4. Now that you have created three word-pairs, write each one onto a separate journal page.
   * **Think about important contemporary issues. Now imagine 30 years into the future and an ideal or positive situation has occurred**, inspired by the word-pair (IE - if it's 2020, think forward to 2050). Think of one-sentence descriptions to explain the scenario. It is okay to take inspiration for your ideas from current events, film, books, news, personal experiences, etc. Write as many responses per word-pairs as you can \(at minimum, two per word-pair\). Limit yourself to 30 minutes.

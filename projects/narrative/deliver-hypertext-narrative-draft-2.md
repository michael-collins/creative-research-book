# Deliver: Hypertext narrative (draft 2)

Iterative improvement is the key to good design. Now that you have peer feedback, tweak, change, and improve your work. Re-read your story and identify where you might be able to further develop characters, increase tension and drama, introduce dialogue, alter story pacing, smooth out awkward transitions, etc.

In this draft, consider the role of style and emerging techniques in your narrative. See examples [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_narrative_techniques.html).

**Consider the following questions:**

* Is there are strong organizational structure to your story? 
* Do the characters have motivations, challenges, and arcs? 
* Is the technology or change you're inventing described in convincing detail?
* Is the story too long? Too short? Does every sentence matter?

## Instructions

1. Review your feedback for the hypertext narrative.
   1. If you are unsure about how feedback works, please see these [guidelines](/toolkit/feedback-and-critique.md).
2. Reflect on how your work can be improved. Analyze, interpret, and apply relevant feedback to improve the project.
3. Record the changes that you made to the hypertext narrative.
4. Publish the HTML file.

## Optional CSS Styling 

As you finalize your story, you may use this time to customize the appearance of your Twine pages using CSS—the declarative programming language used in web development. 

This is an optional step, but it's a great skill to learn if you're interested in web design and a fun way to personalize your story's look.

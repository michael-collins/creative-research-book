# Define: Word pairs

Now that you've finished conducting the observation, it's time to start exploring possible directions for the project. This step is important to help focus the How Might We question that will drive the rest of the project's direction.

## Materials

* Pen or pencil
* Journal

## Instructions

1. Re-read your observations.
2. In your journal, write "**Ritual project: Word pairs...**" at the top of the page.
3. Write at minimum three sentences using the following formula that explain what the object is for: "**_name of the object_** is for the purpose of **_purpose verb or noun_**." The purpose verb or noun will be known at the "purpose word."
1. Lower on the page, write word-pairs at the top. Identify and write a minimum of three word-pairs by matching the purpose (the words from the end of your sentences) to the focus word, "**_[intervention](https://productsofdesign.sva.edu/blog/triage)_**."
    - For example, let's say that the object is a **bed**. A bed could be used for the purpose of sleeping, so _"sleeping-intervention"_ is the word pair that you would generate. A bed could also be used for many other things like studying, healing from illness or injury, hiding from monsters (in the case of a child), or more generally supporting a state of comfort or rest. You could then generate word pairs like "learning-intervention," "healing-intervention," "saftey-intervention," and "comfort-intervention." The word pairs should not be too specific or too broad. For instance, instead of sleep, you could write "rem cycles," which would not allow you much room to conceptualize ideas in the following steps. You could also write "living" instead of sleeping, as it is a requirement for humans to live, however, this would be so broad that it would be challenging to narrow down ideas. These should be universal experiences as much as possible.

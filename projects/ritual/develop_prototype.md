# Develop: Prototype and instructions

Now that you have described the various aspects of the ritual, you will take the work completed in the storyboard and begin to synthsize an experience for a person participating in the experience you have designed.

## Why prototype

> * To fail safely
> * Think with your head and hands
> * To collaborate around
> * To create experiences for gathering feedback from others
> * To get an honest evaluation of different solutions
> * To gain counter-intuitive insights
> * To communicate a vision

## Instructions

Working from your storyboards, start producing instructions and media to explain, support, and facilitate the ritual experience you are designing. The instructions should be written in `.doc` format and the media that you design should support the ritual experience aesthitically or functionally.

## Post work

Use the file format indicated in each step. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements. Please check that your work has uploaded properly.

1. Upload media or photo documentation you have designed to support the experience.
2. Upload the ritual instructions in `.doc` format.
   * Instructions should include the name of the ritual, approximate time required to complete the experience, the ritual steps, and any notes needed for someone to complete the ritual.

# Develop: Instructions for prototype experience

Now that you have described the various aspects of the ritual, you will take the work completed in the storyboard and begin to synthesize an experience for a person participating in the experience you have designed. The ritual (or experience) you are designing is going to be tested by either you or someone else. If you have developed an idea that can not be reasonably produced by you within the timeline of the project, consider going back to a previous step, and identifying a more feasible project idea. If your 'How Might We' question is too specific, you can create another, or revisit your themes and insights to define a new HMW.

**Note:** I highly encourage you to re-read the [project brief](/projects/ritual/ritual_project.md). This ritual design project does not need to solve a problem or develop a novel or new solution. You should also not be purporting to have mastery of professions that are outside of your domain of knowledge (IE â€” you would not claim that your project is therapeutic unless you worked with a professional therapist to develop the project).

## Why prototype

> * To fail safely
> * Think with your head and hands
> * To collaborate around
> * To create experiences for gathering feedback from others
> * To get an honest evaluation of different solutions
> * To gain counter-intuitive insights
> * To communicate a vision

## Instructions

Working from your storyboards, start producing instructions to explain, support, and facilitate the ritual experience you are designing. The instructions should be written in `.doc` format and should support the understanding and execution of the ritual experience. The participant should be able to completely follow every step of the instructions themselves.

**The instructions should include:**
   1. Name for the Ritual or experience
   2. Expected time to complete the experience.
   2. List any supplies, equipment, or materials needed before beginning.
   3. Specify a location if this is relevant.
   4. Please include any instructional materials or visuals that might be needed like diagrams or toolkits (decision trees, etc.).

## Post work

Use the file format indicated in each step. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements. Please check that your work has uploaded properly.

1. Upload the ritual instructions in `.doc` format.
   * Instructions should include the name of the ritual, approximate time required to complete the experience, the ritual steps, and any notes needed for someone to complete the ritual.

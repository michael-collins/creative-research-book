# Discover: Journey Map

A journey map is great way to visualize an entire process of an interaction. By visualizing each step, you will better understand the nuances of an experience. Contextualize the work from your storyboard

**Example steps for a journey map: Mowing the lawn**

1. One week passes since the lawn was mowed last
2. The grass grows longer than the local township ordinance allows
3. I realize the grass is too long.
4. I decide to mow the lawn with my lawnmower.
5. I open the garage
6. I take the lawnmower out of the garage.
7. I check to see that it has enough gasoline - it is low.
8. I fill the fuel tank with gasoline.
9. I start to mow the grass.
10. I stop to get a drink of water halfway through, because I am dehydrated.
11. I empty the grass clippings many times.
12. I finish and put the lawnmower back into the garage.
13. I contemplate the Sisyphean process of lawn-care

# Deliver: Project documentation

Photographs can help ground your work in reality, and give it authenticity and credibility. While digital images have better reproduction quality, they are not as engaging as seeing your work in context of physical space. Take photos and make any needed adjustments to the instructions document.

## Documentation

### Photograph documentation

1. Photograph all physical media and physical outcomes from the project
    - You may have videos used to create your explainer video, feel free to use screenshots of source video (not the explainer video itself).
    - For projects with multiple small or medium sized object, consider [knolling style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sachs#Knolling)
    - If you do not have physical objects, is there a way you could make them physical? (IE - printing templates, instructions, etc)
    - Think about photograph quality. If there is an object designed for the project, consider using a light box or neutral background, setting up lighting, etc. See [examples here](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/diy-lightbox.html).
2. For items that cannot be photographed (or if you have elected not to photograph), submit digital images or screenshots.

### Instructions document

1. Add an photograph or digitally created image to the title page of the document that is representative of your project. If used as a background, ensure all text is still legible.
2. Make any adjustments to the instructions based on testing feedback.

## Post work

1. Submit a `.zip` your photographs and images:
    1. Note: use only JPG or PNG for images. Convert other formats your may have into these formats.
2. In addition to the images, upload a revised PDF instructions document and name it `yourname-instructions.pdf`.
3. Submit the explainer video you created in the project explainer video step.

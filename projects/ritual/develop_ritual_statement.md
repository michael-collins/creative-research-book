# Ritual project statement

Write a 150-500 word project statement that thoughtfully employs relevant and critical art and design language. This statement should be developed with feedback from your instructor to adjust tone, terminology, and structure. You will use MS Word tracked changes to refine and edit the statement over the duration of the project.

The statement's use of language should seek a balance of accurate technical terminology, concise statements about the work, and language that is accessible to a diverse audience and is wholly descriptive. It is easy for artists and designers to adopt opaque language when attempting to describe abstract works. Developing playful language can be a fun exercise, but has the tendency to confuse or shut out those with-out a strong grasp of obscure and creatively constructed language. There are really no rules with how language is used, but ultimately the goal in a work statement is that the artist or designer can clearly communicate their ideas, processes, and outcomes to a wide audience. 

## Structure of the statement

Please write the statement in essay form using proper grammar, sentence structure, and with complete paragraphs. Do not copy and paste the following list of requirements into your statement. Instead, the statement should flow as a single description of your project. Write this statement as if the final draft will be viewed publicly in an exhibition. The following points have been provided as a guide:

1. Include your **project title.**
2. In one sentence, **explain what the project is.** This may include who it's for, or how it works.
   1. **Example:** "This project is an online game for children that teaches players living in war-torn countries how to avoid landmines."
3. **Describe the design challenge** \(the provocation, goal, or existing problem you hope to tackle\)
   1. **Note:** The focus of a design project is not to learn or use software, so please do not place emphasis on particular software \(IE. "This project was made in Photoshop\). Instead, reference the project category \(IE - Branding, animated film, etc.\)
4. **Describe the process** or how you approached solving for the design challenge
5. Describe the **impact** the work might have, the **context** in which it sits, **why it's interesting**, etc.

## Submission details

1. Did you write the statement in essay form and is it at least 150 words? If so, upload the work statement as an MS Word `.doc` to Canvas by the indicated deadline.
2. If you are submitting a second or final draft of the statement, please ensure that you've read the feedback located in the tracked changes including recommended changes as well as comments. Please confirm that changes have been either confirmed or rejected in second or final drafts.

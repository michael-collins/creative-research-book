# Deliver: Project document

Create a project document that gives readers a clear understanding of your project, from beginning to end. This document enables a reader to get a complete picture of the project and its development, must not overly rely on external sources (for video instance links that can go dead), and should be a comprehensive look at your project from start to finish.

Documents can be created in **Adobe InDesign**, but documents produced in MS Word are also acceptable. InDesign allows greater customization with layout and typography, allowing you to better showcase design abilities. The project document must be provided as a PDF document.

You can choose from your predefined styles to create the ToC in the dialog box.
4. **Exporting:** Typically, you will be editing the document as spreads (two pages next to each other as they would appear in a printed book).

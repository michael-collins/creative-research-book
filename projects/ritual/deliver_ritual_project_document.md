# Deliver: Project document

Create a project document that gives readers a clear understanding of your project, from beginning to end.

Documents can be created in **Adobe InDesign**, but documents produced in MS Word are also acceptable. InDesign allows greater customization with layout and typography, allowing you to better showcase design abilities. The project document must be provided as a PDF document.

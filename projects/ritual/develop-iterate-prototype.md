# Develop: Iterate prototype

This is the first round of iterative improvement. Read your feedback and consider how to implement the recommendations from course instructors and your peers. Keep in mind, your work should not be "high fidelity," concentrate on iterating and perfecting the app as if it were a sketch.

## Instructions:

1. Make changes based on the peer and instructor feedback and **download** the prototype file from InVision. You will receive feedback, do not submit without iterating upon your work. 
2. Write a description of the changes made to the prototype in a `.doc` file.

## Post work to the Studio

Use the file format indicated in each step. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements. Please check that your work has uploaded properly.

1. Upload a `prototype-USERID.zip` file of the prototype.
2. Upload a `changelog.doc` with all changes that were made.
3. Write your changes from the changelog.doc into the submission description text box.

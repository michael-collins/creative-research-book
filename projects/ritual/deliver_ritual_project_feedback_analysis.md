# Deliver: Project feedback and analysis

In this exercise, you will complete feedback and analysis for one of your peer's projects. One of the most important skills in understanding the art and design process, is developing the ability to analyze what others did so that you can apply those lessons for improving your own work and critical thinking capabilities. This also gives you the opportunity to apply vocabulary terms an course concepts to help you better understand and retain information about the design process, and to practice your communication and writing skills in a creative context.

## Grading criteria: 

**'A':** Minimum of 500 words. There is evidence that you looked  through and read through the project materials. You cited examples from the project by referencing the paragraph, page, slide, photo or other item. You wrote thoughtful responses to each question. You incorporated some ideas from the course book (online course text Links to an external site.) in your discussion (vocabulary, central themes, other examples). You were able to clearly identify problems and recommend possible alternatives, solutions, or examples from external research that you conducted. You highlighted similar successful art/design projects, artists/designers, and cited links for where to find out more information about them.

**'B':** Minimum of 500 words. There is evidence that you looked  through and read through the project materials. You cited examples from the project by referencing the paragraph, page, slide, photo or other item. You wrote more than a sentence in response to each question. You incorporated some ideas from the course book (online course text Links to an external site.) in your discussion (vocabulary, central themes, other examples).

**'C':** Minimum of 300 words. You wrote simple, one sentence or word answers for the questions, and did not provide advice or meaningful evaluation, or make references to the items in question.

**'D':** you did not show evidence that you understood or followed the directions, or that you only partially looked at the project. There is minimal engagement with the questions provided.

## Instructions
1. **Choosing a project:** In the thread for the explainer video, choose the person who submitted after you. If you were the last person to submit, choose the first person to post in the thread.
3. Watch the explainer video.
4. Read the project document.
5. Look at any other materials provided that can help you get a feel for the project.
6. Complete the feedback and analysis and submit the MS Word document.

## MS Word document structure

1. Your Name
2. Feedback and analysis of Project title by Student's name
3. Course, semester and year (IE - DART 200, Fall 2022)
4. Feedback and analysis

### Feedback and analysis should contain the following:

1. Did this project produce an experience that others can easily follow? Why or why not?
2. Was the project experience clearly explained in the explainer video?
  1. If so, write one clear sentence that describes the project.
  2. If not, write what you think the description of the project should be.
  3. Could the explainer video be improved? If so, in what way?
3. In the project documentation, were any claims made that required a source (for instance, making a claim about "most people" or other statements about people, society, statistics, etc.).
  1. If so, identify the specific claims that were made and state what type of source you think it needs to become credible, or recommend a way to make changes to the writing to avoid generalizing. Often, writing needs to be more specific, or make a more specific reference when talking about people.
4. Was the photo/video documentation sufficient to describe, explain, or otherwise help you understand the project?
  1. If yes, what did it depict and why was it successful?
  2. If not, what specific actions would you recommend to help the designer better tell the story of the project?
5. Could this project be considered a ritual based on the project description?
  1. What did you find valuable about the experience for the participants?
  2. If yes, what aspects enable this?
  3. If not, what could be changed, added or removed to push the project be more ritual-like?
6. Overall, what was the most interesting or successful aspect of this project?

### Submission details

1. The final document should be exported and uploaded as an MS Word document.
2. The filename should be _lastname_-_firstname_\_ritiual-project-feedback-analysis.doc(x)
   - **Example:** collins-michael\_ritiual-project-feedback-analysis.doc(x)

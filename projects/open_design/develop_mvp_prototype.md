# Develop: MVP Prototype

You will now start prototyping with your materials to try to approximate the toy from your product pitch. You will develop an MVP or **Minimum Viable Product** to use in later user testing.

## Constraints

1. You must not spend more than $10.00 USD to assemble the kit.
2. Your users must be able to assemble their kits without special skills or tools. Tools are excluded from the cost restriction.
   1. Allowed tools: Scissors, X-Acto knife
   2. Allowed surface marking implements: Pen, pencil, marker, paintbrush
   
**Review the project requirements listed on the [introduction page](/projects/open_design/open_design_project.md) for this project.**

## Instructions

1. Revisit your research, resources, and product pitch. Make note in your journal of any ideas, insights, themes, or opportunities that you want to explore.
2. Gather an array of materials to work with.
3. **Start experimenting.** Transform manipulate materials, use objects, and create visual modifications.
    1. Take photos of your experiments and outcomes as you work. Don't worry if they are rough or ambiguous.
    2. Five (5) photos minimum.
5. Once you are happy with what you came up with, start to make variations.
6. You should end up with a kit of parts that you can describe to another person how to make and assemble. Take photos of individual parts, templates, connectors, fasteners, and structural elements.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Upload photos of the prototype(s).

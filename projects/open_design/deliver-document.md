# Photo Documentation

1. Single kit of parts image: [knolling style](https://medium.com/@Lyst/your-favorite-insta-aesthetic-has-an-unexpected-history-a929e078d4ea)
2. Photos of various assemblies demonstrating the modular or reconfigurable characteristics of the kit

## Requirements:

1. Parts should be simple \( avoid parts that are difficult to construct or provide instructions for constructing.\)
2. A kit should have more than one part \(parts may be the same\)

There are many examples of modular toys and kits in stores and on the Internet. If you decide to take direct inspiration and remix other works and ideas, you must ensure that there is a good balance between copying, transforming, and combining. There must be some novelty in your work, and it should be obvious that this project came from you.

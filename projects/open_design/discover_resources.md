# Discover: Resources

In this activity, you will be gathering information about the raw materials available to complete the project. Remember, the project brief mentioned that you have a budget between $0 and $10. Ideally, someone with limited financial resources should be able to reproduce your design. Please do not use combustable or explosive materials like matches, or materials that would most likely injure someone such as shards of glass or harmful chemicals. Safety first.

## Instructions

1. **Take Stock:** Photograph materials and objects from around your household or that you discard, or commonly acquire for free with other things that you buy. Of these materials, what might be useful?
2. **Local materials:** Go to a supermarket, hardware, craft supply store, or any other store that may have raw materials you can use. Photograph and document potential materials, objects, fasteners. Pay attention to the inexpensive or bulk products.

## Post work to the Studio

Use the exact indicated file format. You must obtain prior approval to deviate from these upload requirements.

1. Upload 5 to 10 `.jpg` or `.png` photographs of materials. **Do not take screenshots or include images from websites. These materials should be local to you.**

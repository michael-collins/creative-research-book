# Deliver: Project documentation

You will now take photos of the toy assemblies and make any needed adjustments to the instructions document. 

## Documentation

### Photograph documentation

1. Arrange all of the parts, [knolling style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knolling).
2. Photograph the kit parts from above on a flat, white background.
3. Assemble the kit parts into at least three total object variations.
4. Take photographs of the assembled kit toys demonstrating any modular or reconfigurable characteristics of the kit. If you are feeling ambitious, follow [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6fnHEvLyAE) to set up a light box, or see this [instructables tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-Light-Tent/).

### Instructions document

1. Add the knolling-style image to the title page of the document. If used as a background, ensure all text is still legible.
2. Add at least one of the other images to the end of the instructions to show the final result.

## Post work to the Studio

1. Submit a total of four to nine (4-9) `JPG` images:
    1. Submit one (1) knolling style `JPG` image showing the various parts you have assembled for the toy kit.
    2. Submit three to eight (3-8) `JPG` images of the object variants.
2. In addition to the images, upload a revised PDF instructions document and name it `yourname-instructions.pdf`.

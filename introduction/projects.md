# Projects

DMD 100 has three projects, one in user experience and interface prototyping, interactive storytelling, and open product design. These are difficult projects and have been divided into achievable deliverables that follow the Double Diamond design process.

## Submitting projects

When project tasks are completed, they are submitted to [ELMSLN Studio](https://studio.aanda.psu.edu/dmd100/cle/app/projects). This class-wide, virtual space displays your work along with that of your peers â€” mimicking a physical art or design studio environment.

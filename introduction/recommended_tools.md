# Recommended Tools

The tools that best help you produce also help you learn core fundamentals. Overly simple tools obscure some fundamental concepts that you can learn from as a designer and prevent you from gaining mastery, whereas overly complex or poorly design tools prevent you from getting started. We now have greater ability to jump into more complex tools faster due to the abundance of books, tutorials, and entire courses available cheaply or entirely for free. For instance, using a 3D modeling tool like Autodesk Maya a decade prior to this text being written would be nearly impossible without a vast array of expensive textbooks and many hours spent pouring through obtuse technical documentation. Now, finding a free beginner-level tutorial is trivial. Availability of this knowledge puts greater power to produce almost anything in the hands of any person with an Internet connection.

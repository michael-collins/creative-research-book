# Measuring success

To measure success in a way that we can compare one to another, we must have a common understanding about what we mean by success and what we mean by measurement. Some key requirements of achieving success are not overtly teachable, measurable, or relevant for everyone. Determining what success looks like is difficult, as the qualities of a successful student can be different in given contexts. Therefore, to have a universal measurement system that works to any degree of accuracy often means that objective and quantifiable metrics are chosen over subjective and qualitative metrics â€“ and the former of which may be poor indicators of success for a multifaceted design program. In other words, the nature of real learning limits what we can reasonably measure.

In many educational institutions, the grade point average \(GPA\) measures a student's ability to meet the success metrics as set by an instructor or governing assessment entity. There may be some correlation between GPA and success post graduation, but a high GPA does not guarantee a person will get a job or start a business, become well-rounded, or be prepared for the unexpected challenges ahead. A student's attitude and grit are the best indications of success after graduation.

I have assembled a list that attempts to describe the attitudes and attributes that are likely to indicate success:

1. Adaptability
   * Shift mental models to approach problems differently
   * Rapidly identify and learn required knowledge
   * Don't be too adaptable 
2. Understanding
   * Explore a wide array of perspectives
   * Deconstruct complexity into less complex parts
   * Contextualize issues within larger systems
   * Be curious
   * Don't take feedback personally or at face value
3. Focus
   * Prioritize essential tasks
   * Be aware of capabilities and limitations
   * Identify and clear away distractions 
4. Perseverance \(grit\)
   * Don't give up; do what you can with what you have
   * Dedicate time and energy
   * Finish what you start
   * Practice unwavering optimism \(self-effacacy\)
   * Fail fast to eventually succeed
5. Skill
   * Develop intellectual capabilities
   * Achieve technical mastery
   * Communicate appropriately with respective audiences
6. Empathy
   * Put yourself in someone's shoes to better understand why we design
   * Talk to people you want to design for
   * Listen, question, and defer judgement
